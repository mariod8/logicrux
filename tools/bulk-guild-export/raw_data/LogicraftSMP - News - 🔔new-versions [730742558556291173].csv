<https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/new-world-generation-java-available-testing>

**Changes and fixes**
🌳 Tweaked biome placements
🏔️ Made peak biomes and meadows less likely to generate in flat low elevation areas.
🧗 Smoothed out the cliffs in shattered terrain a bit, so they don't look like chunk errors.
⛰️ Added a new mountain biome: Stony peaks.
🏠 Added structures to some of the new mountain biomes.
🏖️ Tweaked beaches a bit, to make them more inclined to show up on flat coastlines rather than hilly areas. Also reduced the amount of stone shores.
💧 Tweaks to aquifers
🐐 Fixed goat spawning
🏜️ Desert temples spawn on the surface rather than at a fixed y level.
🍀 Grass no longer generates under water
🧟 Fixed an issue where players in multiplayer can face far more or far fewer enemies than intended, particularly when other players are flying. Each player now gets their fair share of mobs.
...And more!

**Known issues**
- Low performance
- Messed up Nether terrain
- End pillars don't generate

⛰️ Tweaked placement of the new mountain biomes so they match the mountain terrain and temperature better.
🌨️ Tweaked biome placement to reduce the risk of cold microbiomes, such as a small splotch of snowy tundra in the middle of a forest.
🌳 Fixed an accidental change from last snapshot that made lush caves smaller and more fragmented. Now they should be about as common as in snapshot 4 again.
🌲 Giant tree taiga and giant spruce taiga are now less likely to mixed in with snowy biomes. This caused a small reshuffle of other biomes to maintain the overall balance.
💧 Slightly reduced the number of water springs.
🌊 Aquifers under oceans/rivers are now more likely to link to the underground.
💦 Brought back underwater ravines. Cave carvers can now carve through sand and gravel on ocean floors, so underwater ravines and caves will no longer be hidden under a layer of gravel or sand.
🐴 Horses, Mules, and Donkeys now follow players holding golden carrots, golden apples, and enchanted golden apples. Similarly, llamas follow hay bales.

🍜 Noodle caves can generate at any height, no longer capped at y=130. This means you'll sometimes find tiny cave openings and cracks in mountain peaks. 
🏞️ Some parts of the terrain are slightly smoother.
✈️ Elytra doesn't take durability damage when gliding, only when using rockets. So you don't HAVE to have mending or unbreaking enchantments to use your elytra, especially now that there are higher mountains and cliffs to launch from.
🚀 Elytra rocket boost is a bit weaker, so you can't fly as fast with rockets. Gliding speed is unchanged. This affects just rocket boosting.

**Minecraft 1.18 Pre-Release 1**

The first 1.18 pre-release is here!

From now on, you should mostly see bugs being fixed. In addition to that, pre-releases don't follow the regular snapshot cadence of releasing on Wednesdays, so keep an eye out!

That being said, this pre-release introduces biome blending, which means that you should no longer find harsh borders between new and old terrain. On top of that, we've also reintroduced the Amplified and Large Biome world types.

Happy mining!

*Please note: The Warden hasn’t made its way into the game yet, but it’s getting ready for its big debut!*

🖌️  Changed Sculk Catalyst block to match recent redesign which is described below:
• A mysteriously soul-emitting block that blooms when mobs die within an 8-block radius
• Mobs that perish in the presence of the catalyst will not drop their experience
•  Instead, a bubbling charge will be created at the place the mob perished
• This charge from mobs will spread through Sculk Veins and Sculk blocks in random directions until they find a valid substrate that they can convert into Sculk
• Made some changes to Sculk Sensors to be at parity with Java Edition
